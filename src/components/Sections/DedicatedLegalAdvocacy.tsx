      <SubHeadingText>About Anaheim</SubHeadingText>
      <br />
      <Paragraph>
        Well known as the proud home of Disneyland, Anaheim is not only a great
        destination for visitors, it is also a wonderful place to live. Weâ€™re a
        quick drive from more than 42 miles of Orange County coastline and beach
        cities for those who love the outdoors, and boast a wealth of indoor
        attractions, dining experiences, and shopping opportunities. In addition
        to the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Packing District, and the
        GardenWalk offer world-class restaurants, bars, and unique experiences
        tailored to people of all ages. We are also home to Angels Stadium for
        baseball fans, and the Honda Center, home of the Ducks hockey team.
        Founded in 1857 by German farmers and vintners, Anaheim has become a
        thriving destination city for people from around the world.
