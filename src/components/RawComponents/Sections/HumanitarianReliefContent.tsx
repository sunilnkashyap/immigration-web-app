            <h3>Can You Come to the United States for Medical Care?</h3>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Yes. To seek medical treatment in the United States, you will need
              to apply for a B-2 tourist visa at your local U.S. embassy or
              consulate.
              <strong>You will also need to answer questions about:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your medical situation</li>
              <li>Treatment options available in your home country</li>
              <li>The treatment you are seeking in the United States</li>
              <li>
                Your doctors, hospitals, tests, procedures, medications, medical
                conditions, and potential treatments in the future
              </li>
              <li>How much your treatment costs</li>
              <li>Who will pay for the treatment</li>
              <li>
                Your plans to stay in the United States for a temporary and
                specified period
              </li>
              <li>Your binding ties and intentions to return home</li>
              <li>And more</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Additionally, you may be asked to provide proof of your medical
              condition and your ability to pay for treatment – even if your
              doctor waives certain fees for humanitarian reasons.
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              If you are facing an urgent medical condition, you cannot risk
              having your visa application denied, so you should contact a
              humanitarian relief attorney for help. Consider seeking a lawyer
              in the city you wish to retain treatment.
