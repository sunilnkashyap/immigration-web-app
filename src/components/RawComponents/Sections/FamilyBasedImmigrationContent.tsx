              Are you interested in coming to the U.S. to join your family? Do
              you have relatives overseas and wish to bring them to the United
              States? Family immigration allows eligible loved ones to reunify
              and become lawful permanent residents. However, the legal
              procedures involved can quickly become confusing and
              overwhelming.&nbsp;

            <h3>Who Is Eligible for Family Immigration?</h3>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Only existing U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can
              sponsor certain types of relatives for green cards. Lawful
              permanent residents can only sponsor their spouses and children,
              while citizens can also sponsor their parents and siblings.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              There are two categories of family petitions: “Immediate relative”
              petitions and “family preference relative” petitions. Immediate
              relative applicants receive priority in the U.S. immigration
              system and will move through the process faster.
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              <strong>Immediate relatives include:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spouses of U.S. citizens</li>
              <li>Unmarried children of U.S. citizens under the age of 21</li>
              <li>Parents of U.S. citizens who are at least 21 years old</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              <strong>Family preference relatives include:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Unmarried children of U.S. citizens who are at least 21 years
                old
              </li>
              <li>Spouses of lawful permanent residents</li>
              <li>Children of lawful permanent residents (any age)</li>
              <li>Married children of U.S. citizens</li>
              <li>Siblings of U.S. citizens</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Fiancés of U.S. citizens and their children with U.S. citizens can
              come to the U.S. through K-1 and K-2 visas, respectively.
              Widow(er)s of U.S. citizens may also self-petition become lawful
              permanent residents.
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              An unlimited number of green cards are available to immediate
              relative applicants, but family preference relative categories are
              subject to annual caps under the law. Family preference relative
              applicants must wait for a visa to become available, and this wait
              may last for several years or more.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">

                Our Anaheim family-based immigration attorney can assess you or
                your loved one’s circumstances, walk you through what you should
                expect, and estimate the extent of the wait
              </strong>
              . Our team can also assist you with appeals if your petition is
              denied or revoked.

            <h3>Adjustments of Status versus Consular Processing</h3>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              After your or your loved one’s petition has been approved and a
              visa is available, you can begin the process of changing your
              immigration status and obtaining a green card. If you are already
              in the United States, you will request an “adjustment of status.”
              If you are abroad, you will complete “consular processing” at your
              home country’s U.S. embassy or consular office. Our team at The
              Law Offices of Fady Eskandar has a thorough understanding of these
              immigration procedures and can help you take all necessary steps.
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              <strong>
                Successfully completing either process will result in your
                receiving a green card, which makes you a lawful permanent
                resident
              </strong>
              . You will be able to live anywhere in the United States, and you
              will be able to work most types of jobs. You may also be able to
              apply for
              <a href="https://www.immigrationattorneyhelp.com/practice-areas/citizenship-naturalization/">
                citizenship

              after several years of continuous and physical presence.

            <h3>How to Remove Conditions from a Marriage-Based Green Card</h3>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              If you obtain a green card through marriage to a U.S. citizen, you
              will get a conditional visa if the marriage is less than two years
              old.
              <strong>
                A conditional green card is only valid for two years, and you
                will face significant immigration consequences if you do not
                remove conditions
              </strong>
              . You and your spouse must submit another petition to USCIS in a
              narrow, 90-day window before the visa expires. Expect another
              in-person interview with a USCIS officer, who will evaluate the
              legitimacy of your marriage. If they are satisfied, you will
              receive a non-conditional green card that is valid for ten
              years.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Our Anaheim family-based immigration lawyer understands how USCIS
              scrutinizes new marriages. We can help you remove conditions and
              protect your future in the United States.&nbsp;
